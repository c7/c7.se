summary: There are various serious use cases of WebAssembly out there.

 - Browser based applications, for example [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Adobe Photoshop](https://photoshop.adobe.com/) and [AutoCAD Web](https://web.autocad.com/).

## Fantasy consoles

Three such consoles _(fantasy machines with access to a WebAssembly runtime)_
are [WASM-4](#wasm-4), [MicroW8](#microw8) and [TIC-80](#tic-80).
Over the last couple of years I have experimented with all three of them.

### TipsðŸ’¡

Being able to write some code, compile it into a `.wasm` and have it automatically reloaded in the
fantasy console is great. _(I often use a file system watcher to trigger the recompilation)_

You'll be limited to a number of colors _(in a palette)_, you are however
free to replace the palette with one of your own, or maybe _(more likely)_ one of the
most popular ones from the [Lospec Palette list](https://lospec.com/palette-list) ðŸŽ¨

You can also rely on tricks such as palette shifting [^palette shifting] and dither [^dither]

> I have published a `*-init` CLI for each of these consoles. _(Linked in respective section below)_

---------

### WASM-4

WASM-4 [^wasm4] is currently my favorite fantasy console, it is severely limited.

#### Specs

- **Resolution:** 160x160
- **Colors:** 4
- **Memory:** 64 KB _(A single WebAssembly memory page)_
- **Input:** 4 gamepads with D-Pad + 2 Buttons, Mouse
- **Audio:** 2 pulse wave channels, 1 triangle wave channel, 1 noise channel
- **Storage:** 1024 bytes

#### Example of a WASM-4 cart I've written

<script>window.addEventListener('touchstart', {});</script>
<iframe src="https://assets.c7.se/games/w4-balls/" width="100%" allow="fullscreen; gamepad; autoplay" style="max-height: 100dvh; aspect-ratio: 1/1.7;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### MicroW8

MicroW8 [^microw8] is less limited than WASM-4.
However, I have found its web runtime to be less convenient for development.

> The initial motivation behind MicroW8 was to explore whether there was a way to make WebAssembly viable for size-coding. [^sizecoding]

#### Specs

- **Resolution:** 320x240
- **Colors:** 256
- **Memory:** 256KB (4 WebAssembly memory pages)
- **Input:** (D-Pad + 4 Buttons)
- **Audio:** 4 channels with individual volume control. _(rect, saw, tri, noise wave forms selectable per channel. 32 bytes of sound registers_)

### TIC-80

TIC-80 [^tic80] is a console with an IDE [^ide], not for the code resulting in a `.wasm` though.

> You will need the **PRO** version of [TIC-80](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic80) in order to load cartridges in text format (such as `.wasmp`)

#### Specs

- **Resolution:** 240x136
- **Colors:** 16
- **Memory:** 256KB addressable memory [^tic80 memory]
- **Sprites:** 256 8x8 tiles and 256 8x8 sprites
- **Map:** 240x136 cells, 1920x1088 pixels
- **Input:** 4 gamepads with 8 buttons / mouse / keyboard
- **Audio:** 4 channels with configurable waveforms
