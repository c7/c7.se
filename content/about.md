# About me and the company

## Me

I have used many different languages and technologies over the years as a web developer, but lately the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language and the framework [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/) have been my tools of choice, often combined with the wonderful [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) JavaScript library.

I live in Stockholm, Sweden.

## The company

Code7 Interactive was established in late 2001 and is now a side business to my day job as a System Developer at [Athega](http://athega.se).

What this means is that I only pick projects that are **interesting** and don't have a strict **time frame** for completion.

### Hosting
c7.se is hosted in Stockholm by [GleSYS](http://glesys.se). They offer a variety of hosting options,
including virtual private servers. I can absolutely recommend them.

### Logotypes

I have used the gorgeous [Yanone Kaffeesatz](http://yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/) in my logotypes. The images link to their corresponding SVG versions. **Enjoy!**
